DECRY.PT README FILE v0.2 (2012/2013)

OUR VIEWPOINT.

We strongly believe in the open source community and principals that it was originally founded upon. While we understand the technology we're providing can be used for unethical purposes, it is our intent that its used for educational purposes only.

Nonetheless, we strongly advocate independent development companies that encrypt their scripts to consider the ramifications of those actions. Those very actions hamper the development of the "Internet" which is nothing more than "the people".

DISCLAIMER.

Decrypt primarily provides decryption services of encoding technologies such as; Zend, IonCube, phpSHIELD, SourceGuardian, and/or others for educational purposes only. Decrypt does not accept any responsibility for failure to comply with copyright and/or trademark violations that might be infringed upon by the customer.

PHP BEST PRACTICES

If a file is pure PHP code, it is preferable to omit the PHP closing tag at the end of the file. This prevents accidental whitespace or new lines being added after the PHP closing tag, which may cause unwanted effects because PHP will start output buffering when there is no intention from the programmer to send any output at that point in the script.
